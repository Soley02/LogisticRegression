# LogisticRegression

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Soley02/LogisticRegression/master?filepath=Logistische_Regression.ipynb)

A Binder-compatible repo with a `requirements.txt` file.

## Notes
The `requirements.txt` file lists all Python libraries that this notebook requires and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The base Binder image contains no extra dependencies, so be as
explicit as possible in defining the packages that you need. This includes
specifying explicit versions wherever possible.

If you do specify strict versions, it is important to do so for *all*
your dependencies, not just direct dependencies.
Strictly specifying only some dependencies is a recipe for environments
breaking over time.

In this example we include the library `seaborn` which will be installed in
the environment, and our notebook uses it to plot a figure.
